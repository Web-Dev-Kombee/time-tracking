# Plan for Addressing Linting Issues

This document outlines a structured approach for fixing the remaining ESLint warnings in the codebase.

## Current Status

We have successfully fixed:

- Empty interface issues
- Require-style imports
- HTML link elements that should be Next.js Link components

There are still warnings related to:

- Unused variables and imports
- Usage of `any` type
- Unescaped entities in JSX

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Low-Hanging Fruit

1. **Unused Imports and Variables**

   - Remove unnecessary imports
   - Use destructuring to exclude unused variables
   - Prefix unused but required variables with underscore

2. **Unescaped Entities**
   - Replace single quotes with `&apos;`
   - Replace double quotes with `&quot;`

### Phase 2: Address Type Issues

1. **Create Common Type Definitions**

   - Create a types directory with common interfaces
   - Define models that match Prisma schema
   - Define API response types

2. **Replace `any` with Proper Types**
   - Start with components first, as they're more frequently modified
   - Move to API routes
   - Finally address utility functions

### Phase 3: Enforce Stricter Rules

1. **Update ESLint Configuration**

   - Change warnings to errors once fixed
   - Add more strict rules as the codebase matures

2. **Update CI Pipeline**
   - Add a CI step that runs `pnpm lint:strict`
   - Fail the build if any warnings are found

## Prioritization

Fix issues in this order:

1. Components and pages (user-facing code)
2. API routes (backend logic)
3. Utility functions and helpers

## Tracking Progress

Use GitHub issues to track progress:

- Create an issue for each phase
- Use labels to categorize issues by type
- Assign issues to team members

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 3-5 days
- Phase 3: 1 day

Total estimated time: 5-8 days of focused effort
